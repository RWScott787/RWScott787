- 👋 Hi, I’m @RWScott787 [AKA: Ronald Scott] and I'm still figuring out how to use GitHUb.  It reminds me a lot of Reddit for some reason. 
- 👀 I’m interested in UI/UX Design in addition to basic coding with languages like Python and Swift but, my real passion is Sabre, I'm old school and self-taught.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UI/UX Design principles in addition to attempting to get Microsoft Office Certifications
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on project management opportunities with the goal of becoming a product owner at some point. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Ronald.Scott@aa.com for work-related matters.
